The observation of a new boson~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}
with a mass around $125\GeV$ and properties consistent with the
standard model (SM) Higgs boson was reported by the ATLAS and CMS
Collaborations in 2012. The discovery was followed by an extensive set
of measurements of its properties to determine if they follow the SM
predictions or if there are indications for physics beyond the SM
(BSM). The decays of this boson into two electroweak (EW) gauge
bosons, $\chanHZZ$, $\chanHWW$, $\chanHgg$, can provide information on
the consiustency of its spin-parity with the hypothesis of a spin-zero
scalar SM Higgs boson.

In this conference I reported the results on the Higgs boson
spin-parity properties and tensor structure interactions with EW gauge
bosons using the $\PH\to\PZ\PZ$, $\PZ\Pgs$, $\Pgs\Pgs\to4\ell$,
$\chanHWW$ decay modes, with $\ell=\Pepm,\Pmpm$. The results are
presented in terms of constraints on the anomalous coupling
contributions to the $\PH$VV interactions for the spin-zero
assumption, and exclusion of exotic spin-one and spin-two states.  By
using the $\PH\to\Pg\Pg$ decay channel, the exotic spin-two scenario
can be further constrained.  For the studies presented, the full Run1
LHC data sample collected by CMS experiment at 7 and 8 $\TeV$ is used.
