In this conference the study of a the Higgs boson spin-parity
properties have been presented, through its decays into two
electroweak gauge bosons: $\PH\to\PZ\PZ$, $\PZ \Pgs$,
$\Pgs\Pgs\to4\ell$, $\PH\to\PW\PW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu$ and
$\PH\to\Pgg\Pgg$ decay modes.

For the decays into two massive gauge bosons, $\PZ$ or $\PW$, the
tensor structure of its interactions is studied, for the presence of
anomalous couplings with $\PZ\PZ$ and $\PW\PW$ bosons under spin-zero,
-one, and -two hypotheses. The combination of the results in the two
decay channels leads to a strong constraint on the anomalous
$\PH\to\V\V$ interactions. The $\chanHgg$ allows to put further
constraints on the spin-two hypothesis.

The exotic-spin boson is tested for mixed-parity spin-one states and
ten spin-two hypotheses The spin-one hypotheses are excluded at
greater than 99.99\% CL, the spin-two boson with gravity-like minimal
couplings is excluded at 99.9\% CL, and the other spin-two hypotheses
tested are excluded at 99\% CL or higher, both with production
dependent and independent analyses.

For this reason, the study concentrates on the measurement of eleven
anomalous couplings to the $\PH\PZ\PZ$, $\PH\PZ\Pgg$,
$\PH\Pgg\Pgg$, and $\PH\PW\PW$ interactions under the assumption of
a spin-zero Higgs boson. All observations are consistent with the
expectations for a scalar SM-like Higgs boson.
