In this conference the study of a the Higgs boson spin-parity
properties have been presented, through its decays into two
electroweak gauge bosons: $\PH\to\PZ\PZ$, $\PZ \Pgs$,
$\Pgs\Pgs\to4\ell$, $\PH\to\PW\PW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu$ and
$\PH\to\Pgg\Pgg$ decay modes.

For the decays into two EW gauge bosons, $\PZ$, $\PW$, or $\Pgg$ the
tensor structure of its interactions is studied, for the presence of
anomalous couplings under spin-zero, -one, and -two hypotheses. The
combination of the results in the two decay channels leads to a strong
constraint on the anomalous $\PH\to\V\V$ interactions for spin-one
(excluded at greater than 99.99\% CL) and spin-two (excluded at 99.9\%
CL for gravity-like minimal couplings and 99\% CL or higher for the
others).

The measurement of eleven anomalous couplings to the $\PH\PZ\PZ$,
$\PH\PZ\Pgg$, $\PH\Pgg\Pgg$, and $\PH\PW\PW$ interactions under the
assumption of a spin-zero Higgs boson yields to results which are all
consistent with the expectations for a scalar SM-like Higgs boson.
