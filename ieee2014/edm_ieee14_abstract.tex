\abstract{The CMS ECAL is a high-resolution, hermetic, and homogeneous
  electromagnetic calorimeter made of 75,848 scintillating lead
  tungstate (PbWO$_4$) crystals. It relies on precision calibration in
  order to achieve and maintain its design performance. A set of
  inter-calibration procedures is carried out to normalize the
  differences in crystal light yield and photodetector response
  between channels. Different physics channels such as low mass
  di-photon resonances, electrons from W and Z decays and the

  are used. A laser monitoring system is used to measure and correct

\section{Introduction}

The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) is a hermetic, fine grained homogeneous crystal calorimeter
designed to achieve excellent energy resolution in a wide range of
photon and electron momenta. The multiple purposes that it has to
achieve are the discovery of the postulated Standard Model (SM) Higgs
boson via its decays in di-bosons. In particular the sensitivity of
the decay in two photons is driven by the invariant mass resolution,
and the one in the four lepton by the capability to reconstruct and
identify electrons down to few GeV of transverse momenta.  The ECAL
has to maintain high energy resolution to the TeV energy range in
order to allow the discovery of eventual new physics resonances
involving electrons and photons, and possible candidates for the dark
matter of the Universe.  The ECAL is designed with fine transverse
granularity in order to maintain high identification performances for
electrons and photons with respect hadronic jets.

\section{Overview of the ECAL in LHC Run I and Run II}
The ECAL is located inside the CMS superconducting solenoidal magnet
and made of 61,200 PbWO$_4$ scintillating crystals, mounted in the
central barrel part (EB), closed by 7324 crystals in each of the two
endcaps (EE). The scintillation light is detected by avalanche
photodiodes in the barrel section and by vacuum phototriodes in the
two endcap sections. A preshower detector (ES), based on lead
absorbers equipped with silicon strip sensors, is installed in front
of the endcaps crystals in order to improve $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$
resolution. The geometry is expected to be the same both in LHC Run I
and in Run II, and the operation and calibrations workflow are
expected to be similar, even though new challenges arise for the
higher instantaneous luminosity and radiation doses expected for the
LHC Run II starting in 2015.

\section{ECAL Monitoring and Calibration}


The main effect on the ECAL crystals of radiation at the LHC is a
wavelength-dependent loss of crystal transparency without change to
the scintillation mechanism.  A secondary effect of the radiation is
that the VPT response depends on the accumulated photocathode charge.
These effects are larger in the high $\eta$ regions (in particular the
endcaps) and they will be more challenging in Run II, when the
instantaneous luminosity is expected to increase up to $\approx$
1.5$\times$10$^{34}$, twice the value of Run I. The response change is
measured with a dedicated laser monitoring system. The laser signals
drop exponentially during periods of LHC operation, reaching a
saturation level which depends on the dose-rate (note that the
dose-rate increased in the different periods due to the increasing LHC
luminosity). The observed losses reached during Run I will be
presented in the full $\eta$ region covered by the ECAL. The
monitoring flow in Run II will be similar to the Run I one, with some
changes that will be presented.  The calibration procedure will be
presented, relying in different methods: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\phi$-symmetry method to provide fast inter-calibration by
  exploiting the invariance around the beam axis of energy flow in
  minimum bias events.
\item $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ calibration, using photon pairs
\item electrons from $Z\to e^+e^-$ pairs and $W\to e\nu$ decays,
  comparing the energy measured in ECAL to the track momentum measured
  in the silicon tracker
\end{enumerate}
The performances of these calibration in Run I will be presented, and
the techniques adopted to maintain them with the higher LHC rates and
pileup will be presented.

\section{ECAL energy, H$\to\gamma\gamma$ and H$\to4\ell$ resolution}
The search for the Higgs Boson in the two-photon decay channel relies
on the energy resolution and the position measurement within ECAL of
the reconstructed photons. The simulation of response to photons is
tuned in the different ECAL regions to match the one observed in situ
on $Z\to e^+e^-$ events, where electrons are reconstructed as photons.
The relative invariant mass resolution of simulated H$\to\gamma\gamma$
events will be presented.  The H$\to4\ell$, with decays involving two
or four electrons, cover a momentum range from 7 GeV to $\approx$ 100
GeV, for most of which the energy measurement is dominated by ECAL.
The simulated mass resolution with the ECAL and ECAL plus tracker
combination, after the simulation tuning to match the data will be
presented. A comparison of the Higgs boson mass mesured in the two
decay modes most sensitive to its signal will be presented.

\section{Conclusions}
The CMS ECAL has played a major role in the discovery of the Higgs
boson during LHC Run I. The response variations during three years of
data taking in different conditions have been monitored with the
expected precision, and allowed to mainain the outstanding
performances of its design. The Run II poses new challenges, in terms
of the higher rates expected for the calibration physics triggers, the
higher radiation doses that will affect the crystal transparency
variations, and the higher pileup from both the same and different
bunch crossings.
